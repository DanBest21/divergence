# Divergence

A top-down stealth game with a simplistic art style and a time travel mechanic inspired by the Christopher Nolan film Tenet.

Move around using the WASD keys. Time is bound to a special knife, which can be thrown using the left mouse button. Pressing left shift will rewind time around you to the point at which the knife was thrown.
