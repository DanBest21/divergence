# Divergence

A top-down stealth game with a simplistic art style and a time travel mechanic inspired by the Christopher Nolan film Tenet.

Move around using the **WASD** keys. Time is bound to a special knife, which can be thrown using the **left mouse button**. Pressing **left shift** will rewind time around you to the point at which the knife was thrown.

I was responsible for creating the FOV system, the projectile mechanic, the audio, and the level design. 

Since this was the first major Unity project I undertook, I learnt a lot about the basics of Unity, and game engines in general. In particular, by implementing the FOV system and projectile mechanic, I became much more comfortable with using vectors/linear algebra.
